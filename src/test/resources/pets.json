My name is Bruno and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by a good samaritan on July 23, 2018.<p/><p/>When I first arrived at the shelter I was very scared and nervous. You may noticed I'm a big dog, but I really am more of a big baby. My history is unknown to the shelter since I arrived as a stray, but my caregivers have noticed that I need time and patience to adjust to my surroundings and my people friends.<p/><p/>Once I get to know people, I do enjoy company, but I am not an overly touchy guy. I appreciate a few pets here and there but I have an image to maintain so I do best without a lot of cuddles. This may change with time, but for now I appreciate you respecting my space and giving my attention when I ask for it. I don't want to be doted over.<p/><p/>While I might not be the best fit as a snuggle buddy, I do love to play! Toys are my best frienda! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>Because of my weary nature and sensitivity to handling, I would do best in a dog savvy home with adults only.<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other dogs. I may do best as the only pet in my new home.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/> Adoption Fee: $100.00<p/>",

My name is Bruno and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by a good samaritan on July 23, 2018.<p/><p/>When I first arrived at the shelter I was very scared and nervous. You may noticed I'm a big dog, but I really am more of a big baby. My history is unknown to the shelter since I arrived as a stray, but my caregivers have noticed that I need time and patience to adjust to my surroundings and my people friends.<p/><p/>Once I get to know people, I do enjoy company, but I am not an overly touchy guy. I appreciate a few pets here and there but I have an image to maintain so I do best without a lot of cuddles. This may change with time, but for now I appreciate you respecting my space and giving my attention when I ask for it. I don't want to be doted over.<p/><p/>While I might not be the best fit as a snuggle buddy, I do love to play! Toys are my best frienda! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>Because of my weary nature and sensitivity to handling, I would do best in a dog savvy home with adults only.<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other dogs. I may do best as the only pet in my new home.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/> Adoption Fee: $100.00<p/>", null ]

I love food and I'm not the biggest fan of sharing it with others, so, leaving me alone during my meal times is ideal. I love hanging out with people of all sorts, even older children! I'm not the biggest fan of cats, actually, I'm too much of a fan of cats that I like to chase them...... take me home and you will have a pal for life! <p/><p/>My personality color is RED.

My name is Checkers and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on August 2nd, 2018 because they were moving and could not keep me. My previous owner described me as friendly and sweet. They also said that I like to hang out in windows and watch birds, lay on your lap and that I'm not a big fan of being picked up. <p/><p/>While I have been in the shelter, I have been a bit more sensitive to handling. I prefer to get to know my people and have a home to relax in. The shelter life is no fit for a sophisticated, mature lady like me.<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who likes getting attention on my own terms. I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space. <p/><p/> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p/>", "RED" ]

My name is Mia and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by a good samaritan on February 27, 2018, but have been staying with my foster mom since then. <p/><p/><p/>In my foster home I lived with a small dog and young children. My foster mom said I did well with small children, and while I did get along with the small dog in the home I had a tendency to want to chase birds, squirrels and cats.<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with some small dogs. When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p/><p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>Adoption Fee: $30.00<p/>", "BLUE" ]

My name is Penelope and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous adopter on June 3, 2018 because I was not getting along with the new kitten in the home. My previous owner described me as shy and loving.<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who likes getting attention on my own terms. I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I do not seem to get along with other cats, so I may do best as the only cat in my new home.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/><p/>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p/><p/>1)   Penelope has a history of inappropriate urination. This is most likely caused by inflammation of the bladder, or cystitis.  This condition is also known as feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD).  FLUTD is an inflammatory condition of the urinary tract caused by a combination of stress, diet and water intake.  This condition can be managed through prescription diets, increased water consumption and reducing stress in the household.  This condition may require long term management.  It is recommended that Penelope eat a diet specifically for urinary problems, such as Science Diet c/d multicare.  She would benefit from a partial or total canned diet.  An information handout is included.<p/><p/>As a result of these conditions, your pet may need specialized care consisting of any or all of the below.  Please note this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.<p/><p/>- Special diet or prescription foods<p/>- Prescription or over-the-counter medicines<p/>- Special skin care or shampoos<p/>- Regular veterinarian visits, which may include blood tests or other monitoring<p/>- Possible surgery or other procedures as determined by your veterinarian<p/> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p/>", "RED" ]

My name is Oliver and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on May 8th, 2018 because I did not get along with the other very young and rowdy cats in the home. My previous owner would describe me and friendly, sweet and lover of pets. <p/><p/>I'm a sweet, older gentleman who just wants to take naps, receive pets, get delicious treats and live my best life! I love pets and snuggling up in bed with my people. My caretakers have noticed that I do get along with cats that are closer to my age or cats that are respectful to my calm nature. I'm beyond past my young, rowdy, kitten days! <p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p/><p/>1)   Renal disease.

Your veterinarian may recommend additional testing, medications, prescription diets, or supplemental care as needed.<p/><p/>2)   Grade 2-3/6 heart murmur-  A heart murmur was detected on physical examination.  This means there is an abnormal heart sound when we listen to the heart.  In some animals, this can indicate heart disease.  However, other animals can have heart murmurs and never show any symptoms of heart disease.  We recommend that you follow up with your regular veterinarian.  Please see the handout for more information about this condition.<p/><p/>3)   Moderate dental disease<p/><p/>As a result of these conditions, your pet may need specialized care consisting of any or all of the below.

She is an 11-year-old adoptable cat currently living in a foster home. Unlike most fosters she's not in care because of her age or her health, but because of her attitude. When she first came to the shelter she was hissy and snarly and very difficult to manage. Ordinarily a cat that unfriendly to humans would be put up for adoption as a barn cat, but Gertie is front declawed and would never be able to defend herself outdoors. Her only hope was to get away from the stress of the shelter environment to see if some loving care could bring her back to the light side.<p/><p/>After months in foster care Gertie is a changed cat. Granted, she's still something of a curmudgeon and has definite opinions about how things ought to be, but she enjoys petting and brushing, and has a rumbling purr that she's happy to share. She is more than ready to go to her forever home, ideally where she can rule over her own private space. Gertie needs an adopter who is willing to learn her signals and respect her limits, and who appreciates that winning the heart of a \"difficult\" animal is well worth the patience it will require.

My name is Kitsa and I am available for adoption. I am a 5 year old, spayed, longhaired calico girl. <p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on June 6, 2018 because they could not have me in their new place. My previous owner described me as friendly, playful and active sometimes, and calm and shy other times. I also am quite vocal and love to talk!<p/><p/>One on one, when I am comfortable, I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home! I really am a friendly sweet girl....I just nee someone to love. <p/><p/>I like getting attention on my own terms. I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break.  But I really do love attention.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home without small children or dogs.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space. I am litter trained, healthy, microchipped and have all my vaccinations.  I just need someone to love.  Please come to see me and see if I might be the one for you.<p/> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p/>", "RED" ]

My name is Kharma and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on June 30, 2018 because I prefer to be the only dog in my home.<p/><p/>I can be quite nervous with stranger so I will appreciate a low traffic home with experienced dog owners. When I do know you, I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>I love to play run and play fetch, and will kick a soccer ball around with you too!<p/><p/>My caregivers have observed that I do not get along with other dogs. I will do best as the only dog in my new home.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/> Adoption Fee: $200.00<p/>", "RED" ]

My name is Loki and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on April 30, 2017 because they were moving. I lived in a home with a family that had kids but due to my history of using my mouth when I am uncomfortable, my caregivers are recommending that I go to an adult only home.<p/><p/>I prefer the \"hands-off\" approach, meaning that I will jump on your lap and interact, but it's all on my terms. I tend to get feisty if I get too much attention....typical catitude! I am very food motivated and love snacks and toys.  If you want a cool cat, come adopt me!<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/><p/>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p/><p/>1)     This cat has a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

We recommend you follow up with your regular veterinarian for the best treatment plan.  An information handout is also provided.<p/><p/>2)   This cat has a history of struvite crystals in the urine and urinary tract infections.  He is currently being managed with a prescription diet (Hill's C/D).  This condition will most likely need longterm manament and treatment.<p/><p/>As a result of these conditions, your pet may need specialized care consisting of any or all of the below.  Please note this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.<p/><p/>- Special diet or prescription foods<p/>- Prescription or over-the-counter medicines<p/>- Special skin care or shampoos<p/>- Regular veterinarian visits, which may include blood tests or other monitoring<p/>- Possible surgery or other procedures as determined by your veterinarian<p/><p/> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p/>", "RED" ]
